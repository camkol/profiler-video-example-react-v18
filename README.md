## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- Enter text in the text area.
- The entered text will be measured of how long it would take to read.

## My process

- The React Profiler is a tool that helps developers identify performance bottlenecks in React applications by analyzing component re-renders.
- It records sessions where user interactions occur and displays data related to the commit phase, which is when React updates the DOM.
- To use the Profiler, you install the React Developer Tools extension and access the "Profiler" tab in the browser's developer tools.
- Once you start a recording session, you can perform actions in the app and stop the session to analyze the results.
- The Profiler shows a flame graph with horizontal bars representing components.
- The length of these bars indicates the time each component took to render, with yellow bars showing performance-heavy components.
- By clicking on a component in the graph, you can see details like what triggered the re-render and how long it took.
- To address performance issues, React offers hooks like `useMemo()`, which memoizes expensive calculations, preventing unnecessary re-renders.
- After making performance optimizations, you can use the Profiler again to verify improvements by comparing render times before and after the changes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-Responsive Design
- JavaScript - Scripting language
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was a class project to learn about react profiler.

### Continued development

maybe use later
